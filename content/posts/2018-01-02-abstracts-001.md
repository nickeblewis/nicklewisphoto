Here are a selection of my recent abstracts, they've been taken in various places but that is of course the beauty of abstracts. You can find them anywhere!

I often look out for the little details in the buildings that I come across wherever I am in the World. Some of the locations shared here were literally a stone's throw from my front door. All of the floral shots were taken in my garden!

_my Tamron macro 90mm is my oldest lens but it keeps on delivering the goods! The subject of this photo is a Red Hot Poker or Kniphofia._
