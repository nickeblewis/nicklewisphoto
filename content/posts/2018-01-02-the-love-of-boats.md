I can recall when I first became interested in photography that I would borrow my Dads camera to photograph whatever we found whilst on holiday. I think my love for boats came about as a result of simply spending a lot of time in Cornwall as a child. Once we started to go further afield to the Mediterranean, the interest just grew and grew. 

Roll forward to the current day, I am often exploring places and the coast always draws me in, so much so that I am going to plan a few field trips for the forthcoming months. I need not travel all that far for my own county of Hampshire has a coastline and I can be there within the hour from home.

## Kaloura, Corfu

This delightful little place just had me hooked but time was limited because, the sun was already too high and then a boat full of tourists came in. Then before I knew it, the little harbour was smothered with people who there for about 5 minutes and then vanished!
