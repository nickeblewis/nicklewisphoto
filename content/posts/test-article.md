I hope you all had a fabulous Christmas and New Years Eve? We certainly had a great time and now I am eager to get my teeth into the new year and to eat no more chocolate at least until Easter!!

2017 was a good year, we visited some great places and they will stick on our memories for a long time to come. Two particular trips stand out in my mind and they were our trip to Wales in June followed by a two week holiday in Corfu during September.

I am going to share a few photos here but some I am going to hold back to share in their own posts over the next couple of months. I like to do a retrospective during the Winter months, as I don't get out with the camera as much as I would like.

2017 was also the year of the drone, I got some flights in and some good footage - more of that to come in 2018.
