A visit to Wisley is always worth it’s while, especially on Easter Sunday. It’s a hive of activity with children running riot searching for their Easter bunnies whilst bemused parents watch over them and chat about the more grown up topic of what they should plant in the garden this year. We’ve just about recovered from our double-whammy of snow recently so the sight of some blossom and the hope of a good crop of strawberries this June certainly filled this blogger with joy! If only I had found an Easter Bunny!

Never mind, I went on the search for some pictures instead despite the light still being a little dull.

**I love it** - Blossom is a pleasure to see and it's slowly but surely emerging. We also saw some Magnolia trees with budding flowers whilst we explored some corners of the garden we hadn't seen before.

**Stock shot** - I have recently started to submit some images to [Alamy](http://www.alamy.com/stock-photography/521DDE31-433D-426D-A13B-DDA0009C604F/Nick%20Lewis.html) and I will write another blog artlcile about it at some point in time. In fact most of the shots shared in this blog article are on their way over to them. So a nice green wheelbarrow struck me as being a good editorial shot. Ok they may have many of these already but you never know. I've sold fairly _mundane_ shots before with them as it were!

**Bamboo** - Not sure those Easter Bunnies eat Bamboo but didn't see any Pandas around today either (sorry, my obscure sense of humour is that dry at times, feel sorry for my Wife, she will be greatful).

**No more ice** - Two weeks ago we observed frozen rivers up in North Wales and that seems to have been and gone, we hope now for better weather but the forecast seems to tell a different story.
